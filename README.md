# Task for candidates: Data Analyst (Power BI) 

You are given five files: `Customers_[Vilnius, Kaunas, Other].xlsx`, `Items.xlsx`, `Baskets.xlsx`. 

The data provided is synthetic â€“ i.e. it has been randomly generated. However, imagine that these data files have come from a database of a retail store chain. 
The management of the store chain wants to learn more about their customers and have asked you to makes sense of the data. 
The aim of the task is to create a PowerBI dashboard, which would contain some key insights from the data provided. The dashboard should contain some aggregate metrics (e.g. group means) and visualizations. 

**You should not spend more than two hours for this task.** 

## Data legend: 
`Customers_*-.xlsx` contains some basic data on customers, who are uniquely identified by the variable `c_id`. 

Each of the `Customers_*.xlsx` files corresponds to customer data extracted from a different store location. 

`Items.xlsx` contains some basic data on the items being sold. Each item is uniquely identified by the variable `p_id`. 

`Baskets.xlsx` contains data on the shopping behavior of customers. At what time, they bought which items.
